      <description>This is the second part of GCP&amp;rsquo;s series. In the previous article we covered some basic terminology in GCP. As you know, each virtual machine created has an internal IP assigned. From the same network, you can reach out to this vm using it&amp;rsquo;s internal IP or it&amp;rsquo;s internal DNS.
In that example, I have two virtual machines:
 instance-core: 10.23.0.2 instance-svc: 10.23.0.19
who are located in the same VPC named apps-vpc.</description>

External IP
Outgoing connection to the Internet using internal IP https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview
Cloud NAT gateways are associated with subnet IP address ranges in a single region and a single VPC network. A Cloud NAT gateway created in one VPC network cannot provide NAT to VMs in other VPC networks connected by using VPC Network Peering, even if the VMs in peered networks are in the same region as the gateway.</description>
